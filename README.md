# Fooders

A performant and scalable single page application to order food online.

The app uses states and hooks to manage data within a component locally. The app uses Redux Store as well when the data is required to be stored at a centralized place where certain actions are associated with those data.

To style the app, Tailwind CSS is used.

To make the app performant, different chunks are build within the app and with lazy loading/chunking performance optimization is achieved.

With router providers, the app also enables Routing between the app components.
